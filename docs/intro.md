## What?

EttaUI is an open-source, opinionated React Native component library for building quality, beautiful, accessible bitcoin apps. The components here are inspired by and built on the work of the **[Bitcoin Design Community](https://bitcoin.design)** whose [guide](https://bitcoin.design/guide/) informs and influences the user experience across multiple bitcoin projects. They are awesome!

## Why?

I am currently building **[EttaWallet](https://github.com/EttaWallet)**, a concept bitcoin/lightning wallet. I needed a set of beautifully designed and accesible native components with unified styling across Android and IOS platforms. While this was built to benefit me, I believe it will help others exponentially. Specifically:

- Teams will spend more time solving complex problems, and less time on menial tasks around recreating multiple atoms and molecules.
- The components are built to take advantage of [accessibility APIs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibility) that work alongisde assistive technologies to ensure an inclusive experience for users on Android and IOS.

## For whom?

It's open source so anybody can use this but ideally, most of the components here-in will be useful for anyone building a bitcoin project with React Native. It would be nice to know if this helps you so send me a **[DM](https://twitter.com/rukundo__)** but really, use it. No attribution necessary.

You can use this project by plugging it into your project as a dependency or, you can simply copy and paste those components into your existing projects.

## When update?

:::caution

This is a work-in-progress even though I am currently using this in production for EttaWallet.

:::

This project will continue to be updated alongisde the Bitcoin Design Guide, and as and when I need more components for EttaWallet.

## Contributions welcome?

Of course. You can open an issue or submit a pull request on **[GitHub](https://github.com/EttaWallet/etta-ui)**.
